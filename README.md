# About me 😳
Here is what is worth knowing about me.

## 🔭 I'm a 2nd year student
... at _Audencia Business School_ and _Centrale Nantes_ following the **Bachelor of Business Admistration** (BBA) specialized in _Big Data_ & _Management_. A lot of topics are covered in this degree but the one I'm slowly falling in love with is **Machine Learning**.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot
Here is the link of all the [topics](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/version-francaise/formation/bba-big-data-management-2) covered by this degree for intrested ones. I am also starting the [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction) course made by Hugging Face, it looks like magic to me and who's never wanted to be a wizard ?! There are a lot of side projects, I hope to build a website soon to showcase them properly and hope to render everything I can available here on GitHub.

## ⚡ Other & Fun facts
Nothing is impossible believe in yourself and I'll never be able to thank enough my teachers and everyone who's teaching for making the knowledge available at the extend of their very valuable and limited time ❤️.
