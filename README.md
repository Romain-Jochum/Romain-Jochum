# About ME
Last-year BBA student exploring the intersection of big data, management & AI agents 🤖

I’m a final-year student in the [Audencia](https://www.audencia.com/en) x [Centrale Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version?l=1) BBA program ([FR webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20241026211135/https://www.ec-nantes.fr/version-francaise/formation/bba-data-ia-management-1?l=0) - [EN webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20251116130259/https://www.ec-nantes.fr/study/undergraduate/bba-data-ai-management-1?l=1)), specializing in big data and management. I’m naturally curious and love diving deep into how things work, especially in the emerging world of agentic AI. I use my studies as a base, but I’m really driven by what I build on my own time.

Right now, I’m focused on creating and self-hosting AI agents and RAG systems using Python and LangChain, running on Proxmox and Linux machine to host the projects. I’m not “the best”, but I make up for it by combining past experiences and lean process to produce faster and more efficiently. Working on AI genuinely feels like a pleasure to me 🚀

## Romain in 5 bullet points 
- 🧠 AI & automation: Building and self-hosting AI agents / RAG systems with Python, LangChain, Linux and Proxmox
- 📊 Data & management: Background in big data & management, able to connect technical work with operational and business needs
- ⚙️ Systems & productivity: Using Obsidian, GitHub, and my own agents to organize knowledge and streamline how I produce
- 🎬 Content & communication: Experience in video creation → engaged audience (could be you next !)
- 🏃‍♂️ Mindset from sport: Triathlon has taught me discipline, consistency, and how to handle long-term challenges by focusing on results and on the daily prayers toward the gods to once again bless me and help me dodge injuries and shoulder pain.
