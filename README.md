I am a final-year student in the **Audencia × Centrale Nantes BBA** program, specializing in **Big Data & Management**.

I’m naturally curious and enjoy deeply understanding how systems work — particularly in the emerging world of **agentic AI**. While my academic background provides strong foundations, I am primarily driven by what I **design, build, and self-host** outside the classroom.

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Working On

- 🤖 **AI Agents & RAG Systems**  
  Designing, building, and self-hosting AI agents using **Python**, **LangChain**, and modern LLM tooling.

- 🖥️ **Infrastructure & Self-Hosting**  
  Running projects on **Linux** with **Proxmox**, focusing on reliability, reproducibility, and full-stack ownership.

- ⚡ **Lean Execution**  
  I may not claim perfection, but I compensate with **structured thinking, past experience, and efficient processes** to move fast and ship consistently.

Working on AI systems genuinely feels like a privilege — and a lot of fun 🚀
